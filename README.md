MongooseCompare
===============

Reason of using that is simple. Mongoose gives you great power of populating sub documents referred by MongoID. Sometimes
in my code I had to create condition that might find populated or non-populated data. Sometimes also it would compare data
that was actually Mongoose model or cleaned plain JSON object. Despite where I used some bits of logic, I wanted to keep
all simple. It will add of course some overhead, but helps to maintain clean code.

Installation
------------

```
npm install mongoosecompare --save
```

Simple as that

Usage
-----

```

var comp = require('mongoosecompare'),

(...)

var varA = mongoose.Types.ObjectId();
var varB = '55149130c26e4eba0e32a273';

(...)

if(comp(varA, varB)) {
  ...
}

```

or see tests.

Other features
--------------

 * Fallback any model or object ID to string ObjectId
 * ObjectId validation more strict that mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid

Dependecies
-----------

This lib uses only `mongoose` and `top-require`. Top Require allows me to import the same copy of mongoose you have installed
in your app. So, if you modify anything it will be taken in account.
